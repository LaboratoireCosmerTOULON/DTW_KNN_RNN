</p>
This repository is organized as follow: 

+ /data directory that contains the data used in the paper. 
+ /DTW-KNN include for the DTW classification
+ /RNN includes the RNN-based classification

## DTW-KNN
The subdirectory DTW-KNN contains all the code need to perform the SVM seperation and the DTW-KNN classification. 
The subdirectory inlcudes the  following folders: 
- yaml/ 
- scripts/
- utils/
